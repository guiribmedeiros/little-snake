## About Little Snake

Little Snake is the reimplementation of the Snake game created in 1976 for the arcade game Blockade. This project was developed for personal research and testing purposes with [JavaScript](https://www.ecma-international.org). Little Snake is the literal translation for **"Jogo da Cobrinha"** because it's how the Brazilian kids call it and can entertain you even on your Nokia 6110 by [@nokia](https://github.com/nokia), see more:

- Try it at a [Live Example](https://little-snake.guiribmedeiros.io).

Little Snake is an open-sourced game. It is written in [JavaScript](https://www.ecma-international.org).

## Getting Started

First, let’s make sure that your development environment is ready.

- If you don’t have **Node.js** installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/).

Then install **serve** by running the following command:

```
npm install -g serve
```

Finally, after installing, the `serve` script starts your "static development server" on port 5000.

```
serve
```

That’s it! :rocket:
